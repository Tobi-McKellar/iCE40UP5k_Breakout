This is a simple FPGA breakout board based on the iCE40UP5K. Exposing 16 GPIO via two 6x1 PMOD ports and one 6x2 PMOD port, as well as 11 LEDs, 3 buttons, and one capacitive touch button, the board can be powered via USB-C or the appropriate mounting holes. Programmed via [SOIC-Bite](https://github.com/SimonMerrett/SOICbite/blob/master/README.md). The schematic and PCB can be viewed online [here](https://kicanvas.org/?github=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTobi-McKellar%2FiCE40UP5k_Breakout%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FFPGA_SOM) via KiCanvas.
