This is a simple FPGA system on module based on the iCE40UP5K. It is currently in the testing stage with V1, and V2 is likely to be manufactured in the near future. V3 will focus on efficency improvements by using switch mode power supplies instead of linear regulators, and V4 will package the whole lot into a small bundle.
I may also develop a programming board using an FT232H.
